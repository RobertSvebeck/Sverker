Create a discord bot

1. Go to the Discord Developer Portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications) and log in.
2. Click on the "New Application" button. Give your application a name and click "Create".
3. Click on the "Bot" tab on the left side of the screen, then click "Add Bot". Confirm by clicking "Yes, do it!".
4. Under the "TOKEN" section, click "Copy" to copy your bot's token. This token is what your bot uses to log in to Discord, so keep it secret!
5. Now, you need to invite your bot to a server. Click on the "OAuth2" tab on the left side of the screen.
6. Under the "SCOPES" section, select "bot". Then, under the "BOT PERMISSIONS" section, select the permissions your bot needs.
7. Copy the generated URL and open it in your web browser. Select a server to invite your bot to.
8. Your bot is now created and has been invited to a server! You can start coding it using a library like discord.py.

Remember to replace <token> in your code with the token you copied earlier. Never share this token with anyone, as it allows full control over your bot.

create the environment variable (windows: setx SVERKER_TOKEN "REPLACE WITH TOKEN FROM DISCORD DEV")

1. git clone <repository_url>
2. cd <project_directory>
3. python -m venv venv
4. venv\Scripts\activate
5. source venv/bin/activate
6. pip install -r requirements.txt
7. python sverker.py
